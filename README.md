# Repository Branches Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the different branches in the repository and their purposes. It aims to help the team understand the workflow and purpose of each branch.

## Branches Overview

### Main Branch

The `main` branch is the primary branch of the repository. It represents the latest stable version of the project and should always contain production-ready code. Major releases and significant updates are merged into this branch.

#### Purpose:
- Represents the current production version.
- Code in this branch is deployed to production environments.

### Test Branch

The `test` branch is used for testing and quality assurance purposes. It is where new features, bug fixes, and other changes are tested before being merged into the main branch.

#### Purpose:
- Testing new features and bug fixes.
- Ensuring code quality and compatibility before production.

### Delivery Branch

The `delivery` branch is dedicated to preparing releases for deployment. Once features are tested in the test branch, they are merged into the delivery branch for final integration and packaging before deployment.

#### Purpose:
- Integrating tested features and changes.
- Preparing for deployment by packaging and finalizing releases.

## Branch Workflow

Here's a simplified workflow for managing branches in this repository:

1. **Feature Development**:
   - Create feature branches off the `main` branch for new features or bug fixes.
   - Regularly commit and push changes to the feature branch.

2. **Testing**:
   - When a feature is ready for testing, create a pull request (PR) to merge it into the `test` branch.
   - Reviewers perform code review and testing in the `test` branch.

3. **Integration and Delivery**:
   - After successful testing, create a pull request to merge the feature into the `delivery` branch.
   - Additional integration testing and packaging can be performed in the `delivery` branch.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Once a release is ready, merge the `delivery` branch into the `main` branch.
   - Deploy the changes from the `main` branch to production environments.

## Conclusion

Understanding the purpose and workflow of each branch in this repository is essential for maintaining a stable and efficient development process. Following the outlined guidelines will help ensure that code is properly tested, integrated, and deployed.
